# Business Understanding

When trying to sell a home, maximizing profit is typically a high priority and rennovations are a key way that to ensure homeowners are getting the most they can from their listing their home. Renovations are important when trying to resell a home for several reasons: 
1. Market demand: The size of a home, as indicated by its square footage, is a key factor that affects market demand. Buyers often have specific space requirements based on their lifestyle and family needs. Renovations that increase the square footage, such as adding an extension or finishing a basement, can expand the home's appeal and attract a wider range of potential buyers.
2. Functional and practical considerations: The number of bathrooms and bedrooms directly impacts a home's functionality and practicality. Buyers typically seek homes with an adequate number of bedrooms to accommodate their family members or provide additional space for guests. Similarly, having an appropriate number of bathrooms is crucial for convenience and privacy. Renovations that add or modify bedrooms and bathrooms can significantly improve the home's functionality, increasing its value and marketability.
The square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms are essential criteria used in analysis to determine the value of a home. Appraisers and real estate agents consider these factors when assessing the value of a property and comparing it to similar homes in the area. Renovations that align with these criteria can positively impact the home's appraised value and make it more competitive in the market.


# Data Understanding

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which describes homes in the area with attributes such as, price, bedrooms, bathrooms square footage, etc. First I am going to go through the dataset and determine what I find to be most useful and relavent to the analysis. Once I establish what is needed, I will clean up and transform the data to best fit into the OLS model.
